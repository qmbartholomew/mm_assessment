## Description 
*Overview of this code assessment:* 
> Your coworker messed up the provided code and now it doesn't work as it should. Your manager has tasked you with the challenge of figuring out what is wrong with the code and fixing the issues. Once those issues are fixed you are tasked with creating a new function to get the number or recipes that meet the criteria outlined below. If you have extra time, complete the bonus.
 1. Edamam is a recipe API that allows the user to find recipes and nutritional information. Fix the code so you can make an API call and get recipe information back using the Edamam API.
    - Collect data from the api.
    - Return the chicken recepies that are in the 'Mediterranean' food trend & under 5000 calories as an array
 2. After you fix the call_edamam_api function create another function that sends a query to the API to find all recipies that are vegan, gluten free, and have cilantro in the recipe.
    - Give us the number of recipes that meet this criteria. 
 3. BONUS: Make a function that returns the most popular health label from the array that is returned from the function call_edamam_api.
